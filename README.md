# mapping
A general repository for storing spatial analysis methods I have used. Contents continually being added, currently includes: 
- Mapping data to country and EEZ polygons using national aquaculture data
- Creating raster and xy grid from shapefile using FAO marine regions
- Creating a raster land mask (to isolate ocean cells or vice versa)
